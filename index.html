	<h1>Welcome to Kay Park Memorials</h1>
    <p>We are an independent, family-run business located on Grassyards Road in Kilmarnock. Coming from a family of stonemasons, spanning four generations, John Bayne started Kay Park Memorials as a continuation of his family business - previously Thomas Bayne and Sons. John has over thirty years of experience, providing quality headstones and cemetery services. We are RQMF (Register Qualification of Memorial Fitters) registered and pride ourselves in delivering a high standard of workmanship and unrivalled customer care.
Although based in Kilmarnock, at Kay Park Memorials we expand our approachable, caring and professional services to the surrounding towns across Ayrshire and further afield - and even have examples of our work in the Isles of Skye, Arran and Gigha. <br><br>
    
    Although based in Kilmarnock, Kay Park Memorials also endeavour to offer a friendly, caring and professional service outwith this area, and indeed have had customers as far afield as Canada and South Africa. So if you're from Kilmarnock, Irvine, Ayr, anywhere in Ayrshire or further afield, feel free to contact us and we will be happy to assist you.</p>
