	  <h2>About Us</h2>
		
	  <img src="images/aboutus.jpg" alt="aboutus">
	
	  <p>Kay Park Memorials was established by John Bayne in 2008, after a four-year hiatus following the closure of his father's business: Thomas Bayne and Sons. The business started on the same grounds, which has been home to the Bayne family for three generations. <br><br>
 
For over twenty-years, John worked with his father Freddy in the business, which was founded by his grandfather Thomas Bayne. After Freddy's retirement, John and his family moved into the house, and the business was subsequently closed. However after four years, John finally decided to start back at this family trade, and Kay Park Memorials was established.<br>

	  <p>Kay Park Memorials is a family-run business consisting of John Bayne, his wife Angela, and their two sons, Aaron and Nathan. For eleven years, the business has delivered high-quality headstones, vases, memorial stones. John has been praised for his approachability, patience and honesty in handling what is best for you and your family. <br><br>
 
Although a small local business, Kay Park Memorials strives to provide a personal and caring experience for each person that walks in their door.</p>
